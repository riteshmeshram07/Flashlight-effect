      <h1>A STORY ABOUT A FARMER AND 
        HIS PRISONER SON.</h1>
      <br>
<p>
    In a certain village lived a farmer and his only son. The SON was a thief who goes about stealing from people’s homes. He continued this wicked lifestyle till the day his cup got filled. He stole heavy some of money from the richest man in their village, that day he didn’t escape successfully as he used to. The farmer involved the police immediately he found out that his money was missing and the police started investigating, and finally they found out that the boy stole the money so they sent him to prison.

After some months, it was time for farming and the farmer was already old and weak and can’t dig the ground anymore so the old farmer wrote this letter to his son in prison. "Son, this year I will not plant cassava and yam because I can't dig the field, I know if you were here you would have helped me".

The son was really touched by his father’s letter so he thought a plan, and replied his father "Dad don't even think of digging the field because that's where I buried the money I stole".

The POLICEMEN on reading this letter went early in the morning and dug the whole field in search of the money but nothing was found.

The next day the son wrote his father again "Dad you can now plant your cassava and yam this is the best I can do from here."

Dad replied "My son, you are too powerful indeed, even in prison you still command policemen to work for me. I was so surprised to see the IGP and his team holding hoes and shovels, digging my farm. I will write to you when I want to harvest."
